# ai_assignment1
The purpose of this assignment was the implementation and comparison of the weighted A* and IDA* algorithms in an optimal path finding problem. The problem is silved offline and then follows the optimal route that gets generated.The implmentations use 2 heuristics, the Euclidean and the Octile distance.
